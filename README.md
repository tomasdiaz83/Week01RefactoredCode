Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

An exercise in refactoring a web application's code for accessibility. I endeavored to make the code as semantic as possible, organized the code through use of varied element tags and comments, and consolidated the css by means of streamlining redundant ids and classes.
